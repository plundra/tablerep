Goal
----
Replicate a table to another database on changes.


Short details
-------------
INSERT, UPDATE and maybe other operations (DELETE, TRUNCATE, ?) on the
source table should be replicated to a (similar) table somewhere else.
It only needs to be one way, the receiving end only does reads.


Implementation ideas/details
----------------------------
Install a standard audit-style trigger on the source table, emitting a
NOTIFY with the primary key as payload, maybe what kind of change too.

Then having a helper-script outside of postgres running LISTEN to
catch when changes occur and applying them on the recieving table.


Pitfalls / To be figured out
----------------------------
Things to be figured out or be aware of:
 - Initial sync
     We can probably get away with a huge COPY and manually keep track
     of PKs changing while it is running. Else some sort of queuing is
    needed, probably.

 - Out of sync
     Could be due to the LISTENer not running or something unknown.

 - ... more ...


Thoughts during implementation
------------------------------
 - source_notifier.sql
     Hardcoded "key" column for OLD/NEW for now. No need for portability now.
 - Just as the above, trigger-functions should be more generic.
 - ... more ...
